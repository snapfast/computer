    - [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5): A widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It's commonly used to verify data integrity.
    - [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1): Cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It's used in various security applications and protocols.
    - [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2): Part of SHA-2 set, SHA-256 generates an almost-unique, fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash. It's a favorite in security applications and protocols.
    - [HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC): A specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. It's used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message.
