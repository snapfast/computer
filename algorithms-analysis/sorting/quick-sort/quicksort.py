Input:
7 4 8 9 2 5 1 6




Quick Sort algo:
1. Choose a pivot, partition the array at the pivot element. Generally, the middle element.
2. Start 2 pointers from start and end.
3. Swap the elements if the start is bigger than the end, and the end element is smaller than pivot.
4. Move one position, after swap, then check point 3 again.
5. Once completed, start from 1 to 4 in the left, then right partition. Until sorted. :)
